Policy Deployment
=================

For deploying policies on the robot, we use the Unitree SDK in combination with LCM to pass state and actions between the controller and ROS.
You'll see an example adapted from Teddy Liao's update of the Unitree SDK in the repository.
If using the built-in Orion, you can also configure the robot via ethernet and then disconnect the cable, though this requires a proper torch and cuda setup on the unit.
