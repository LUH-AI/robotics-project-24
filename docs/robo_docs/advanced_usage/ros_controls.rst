ROS Controls
============

Unitree proves an interface for ROS2: https://support.unitree.com/home/en/developer/ROS2_service
This enables all sorts of control and sensor reading functionalities. It is also (via a wrapper) how we do RL deployment.
On its own, it's mostly useful to learn how Heinrich operates since direct control via ROS is not the best option for research.
Here are some examples of what you can play around with: https://www.docs.quadruped.de/projects/go2/html/go2_driver.html#go2-mode-activation
