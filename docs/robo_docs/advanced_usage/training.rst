RL Agent Training
=================

For RL training, we recommend using Isaac gym since it has an exact model of Heinrich built-in. This repository contains a training example with Mighty.
Please be aware that it is crucial to use an actual model of Heinrich, i.e. the Unitree Go2, for training. DO NOT try to deploy policies for other platforms, as they will not work and might damage the robot!
