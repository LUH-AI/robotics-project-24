.. glossary::

    Robot Body
        Heinrich's actual body. It is located in the RL office on its stand. The battery is stored separately.

    Robot Stand
        The stand for Heinrich. It is located in the RL office. It is not the most stable stand, so be careful when using it.

    Transport Suitcase
        When transporting Heinrich, use the suitcase. It is located in the RL office. Don't try to carry Heinrich any other way, he is quite heavy!

    Batteries
        We have two batteries for Heinrich. They are located in the RL office. The batteries are quite heavy, so be careful when handling them.
        They should always be removed and charged after use.

    Lidar Camera
        The camera that is mounted on Heinrich's head. It is located in the RL office. It is quite fragile, so be careful when handling it.
        This is an optional accessory, so it is not always mounted on Heinrich and should only be added when needed.

    Remote Controls
        There are two remote controls for Heinrich. They are located in the RL office. 
        The small remote is for basic controls and the big remote has more advanced options. Please remember to charge them after use!
        The best control option is via the phone, so we recommend using the app.
