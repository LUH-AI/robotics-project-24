Python Interface
================

There is a python interface to ROS for Heinrich provided by Unitree: https://support.unitree.com/home/en/developer/Python
This is a server-client wrapper of the direct ROS interface and can do similar things: play pre-configured motions, read sensor data, and perform wellness checks.
This is NOT a functionality interesting for research, but it can be useful for quick tests and demos.
If Heinrich should be used as a demonstrator with hardcoded action options or if we want to add new pre-coded motions, this is likely the easiest way to do it.
